    If you want to allow users to omit domain names when using Jenkins, you can specify the desired domain name here.
    This is useful in some setups where Kerberos Authentication does not work when the domain name is not specified.
    Users will be redirected from e.g "yourjenkinsmachine/manage" to "yourjenkinsmachine.domainname.com/manage".
    Your domain will be something like "address.com"
